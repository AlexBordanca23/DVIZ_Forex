# A Profitability Analysis on Longer Term Trend-and-Breakout Oriented Trading of Five FOREX Currency Pairs #

***This project was initially completed as part of the Topics in Data Visualization Course at Indiana Univeristy-Bloomington, Luddy School in collaboration with David Thiriot.***

This project explores the potential of longer-term trend-and-breakout oriented trading strategies in the FOREX market. The objective is to construct a visualization-based trading model that identifies profitable entry and exit points. The study focuses on five major currency pairs: Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Australian Dollar, and Swiss Franc.

## Achievements: ##

Market Insight: The project provides valuable insights into the FOREX market, highlighting its vast liquidity and volatility compared to other financial markets.

Strategic Focus: The approach is centered around developing a trading model that combines visualization-based techniques with algorithmic execution, targeting both profitability and ease of use.

Model Refinement: The initial approach of using exponential moving average (EMA) crossovers is refined into the 'ForexTradeFinder' algorithm, which leverages short-term trend analysis for trade initiation and exit decisions.

Algorithm Development: The 'ForexTradeFinder' algorithm is devised to identify potential trends, initiate trades, and determine exit points based on trend reversals. A comprehensive process flowchart demonstrates the logic behind the algorithm.

Visualization: The project uses time series plots, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize trade actions' profitability and duration, effectively conveying the model's performance.

## Project Description: ##

The project commences with an exploration of historical price data for the five currency pairs, aiming to comprehend their distribution and trend patterns. The emphasis shifts from basic exponential moving average (EMA) crossovers to the development of the 'ForexTradeFinder' algorithm. This algorithm utilizes short-term trend analysis to make trade entry and exit decisions, driven by the principle of "buy low, sell high." The process is visualized through a decision-making flowchart.

The 'ForexTradeFinder' algorithm is tested on the selected currency pairs over a span of almost two decades. Results showcase the algorithm's ability to identify profitable entry and exit points, leading to an overall cumulative gain across the currencies. Visualizations in the form of time series plots, histograms, and scatter plots illustrate trade actions' profitability and duration.

In conclusion, the project establishes the potential of visualization-based trading models for identifying profitable trading opportunities in the FOREX market. The insights gained and the 'ForexTradeFinder' algorithm lay the foundation for further optimization and refinement of trading strategies in the currency trading landscape.
